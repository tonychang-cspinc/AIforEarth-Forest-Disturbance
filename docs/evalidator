# Evalidator validation methods

https://apps.fs.usda.gov/Evalidator/evalidator.jsp

Here we describe the methods for performing validation in the same manner as the USFS for their modeling efforts. Some things to consider include

1. Retrieval Type
	* State or Circle retrieval
		* Here we might try both methods, but defaulting to Circle
		* Circle method requires the parameters
			- Latitude in decimal degrees
			- Longitude in decimal degrees
			- Radius in miles (here we are unsure of this radius, do research)
2. Land Basis

	* All land, Forest Land, Timberland
		- All land is both forest land and timberland
		- Forest land is defined as land that is 10 percent forested by trees of any size
		- Timberland is forest land that is available to harvest and capable of productivity (this implies some minimum basal area and average DBH; can produce 20 cubic feet of wood per acre per year)

3. Numerator and/or Denomitor Estimate Group
	* Selection of the various forest structure metrics we might be trying to compare, specifically:
		- Tree carbon
		- Tree basal area

# Using the FIADB_API
